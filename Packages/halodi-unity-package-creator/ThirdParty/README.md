# Third party libraries

To avoid conflicts between packages all third party managed DLL's are prefixed with "78E813DA", which is the CRC32 hash of "com.halodi.halodi-unity-package-creator".

Due to the 260 character limit on windows paths, we avoid prefixing the DLL names with "com.halodi.halodi-unity-package-creator"
